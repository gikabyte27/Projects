# API Wordlists

> George Tudor | March 8, 2024

----------------------------

## Usage

- You can create more wordlists tailored to your needs using the files in the `seeds/` folder
- First fuzz with the small wordlist, then continue with the medium and last with the large one
- The `seeds/` folder can be used as multiple placeholders in Burp's Intruder ($version/$actions/$object or $version/$wild etc.)
